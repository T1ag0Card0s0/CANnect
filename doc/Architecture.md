The PlantUML architecture diagram has been moved to `doc/Architecture.puml` for better compatibility with PlantUML tools and extensions.

To view or edit the diagram, open `doc/Architecture.puml` in a PlantUML-compatible editor or extension.

Example render command (if you have PlantUML installed):

```sh
plantuml doc/Architecture.puml
```
